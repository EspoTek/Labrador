<h2>AC-coupled pins</h2>

<p>
    The AC coupled pins remove the DC component from your signals, and are meant
    mainly for audio purposes and dual-ended opamps.
    <strong>For general use, you will almost always want to use the DC-coupled pins</strong>,
    as they do not alter your signal in any way.

<h2>Duplicate oscilloscope pins</h2>
<p>
    The duplicate oscilloscope pins are there for measuring resistance and
    capacitance on the multimeter.  You do not need them otherwise.
</p>

<h2>Fuse bypass pins</h2>
<p>
    The fuse bypass pins (to the immediate left of the USB connector on the
    diagram) are used for bypassing the fuse, if you need to, by shorting them
    together. The top pin, as seen on the image, is a 5V pin directly from the USB
    connector, and the bottom pin is the 5V output of the fuse.
</p>

<p>
    The fuse is a PTC resettable fuse, with a maximum current of around 400 mA.
