/* isoBufferBuffer is implemented as two consecutive, duplicate,
 * ring buffers. the effect of this is that we are able to hand
 * out pointers to pieces of contiguous memory representing the
 * last N inserted elements (for some N <= capacity()) even
 * when we looped back to the begining of the ring buffer less
 * than N insertions ago
 *
 *     There are some differences with the original implementation
 * functionality-wise.
 *     Where the original implementation allowed queries half as
 * long as the length passed in, and allocated a buffer 1.5 times
 * the length passed in, this version allows queries of length up
 * to the length passed into the constructor and allocates a
 * buffer 2 times the length passed in.
 *     Overall, this means that in contrast to the original
 * implementation which only allowed queries up to a third as
 * long as the allocated buffer, we can now do queries as long as
 * half of the allocated buffer, which is a notable improvement.
