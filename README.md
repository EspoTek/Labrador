# Licence
All software files are licenced under GNU GPL v3.  https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

All hardware files (schematics, PCB) are licenced under Creative Commons 4.0 (CC BY-NC-SA).  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

The intention is to move to a less restrictive licence in future, where commercial hardware derivatives are allowed but the use of the Labrador name or any branding is not.  If anyone knows how to implement such a licence, I'm all ears.

# Known bugs.
Most of the main bugs have now been fixed, including all synchronisation issues.
There are still a few small bugs, most notably a crash when you disconnect and reconnect the board on a non-Windows platform, and the issue with the logic analyzer still persists.  Both will hopefully be cleaned up before launch.

# Collaboration
Mailing list is here and open to all who wish to collaborate on the project:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/labrador-devel

Thanks to all.
