# Licence
All software files are licenced under GNU GPL v3.  https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

All hardware files (schematics, PCB) are licenced under Creative Commons 4.0 (CC BY-NC-SA).  https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

The intention is to move to a less restrictive licence in future, where commercial hardware derivatives are allowed but the use of the Labrador name or any branding is not.  If anyone knows how to implement such a licence, I'm all ears.

# Known bugs.
Most of the main bugs have now been fixed, including all synchronisation issues.
Please open an issue or email me at admin@espotek.com if you're aware of any in particular.

Or you can just use GitHub's issues.  :)

# Cleanup Notice
Please note that this repository was cleaned up on 21/10/17.
This significantly reduced the size - from over 200MB to about 3MB, but I was fairly aggressive and it's possible that something was deleted that shouldn't have been.
For this reason, the old, unclean repo has been preserved at:

Thanks to all.
